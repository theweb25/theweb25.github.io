design stuff
always make the bg has a hint of a glowing blue
make sure these sound effects are always used around the app
enter: son0ra.github.io/sfx/enter.mp3 , when another page of the app is opened
error: son0ra.github.io/sfx/error.mp3 , when an error occurs
hover: son0ra.github.io/sfx/hover.mp3 , when a button or another link is touching the cursor
success: son0ra.github.io/sfx/success.mp3 , when an action succeeds
notice: son0ra.github.io/sfx/notice.mp3 , just a notification. not an error or a success.
these links will be used and coded into the app , corresponding to the action
-- ui elements
a notification will slide in from the bottom right, sliding from the right, showing an error or a notice.
make sure not to brag about "special" elements like glassmorphism and anything i mention to you.
if i say make something better, do not add "but better" to the title, and anything similar, unless i tell you to change it.
if i do not ask for a different font, form it into a mix of poppins and lexend.
add a few gradients, too
add animations to anything you can add them too, without it looking to tacky
make the accent color BLUEE.
